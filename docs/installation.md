# Setup

To get you ready to hit the ground running, please set up the prerequisite accounts and software listed below before the course starts.

## CyVerse Account Creation

We will be using several services that require you to create a user account.

| Account | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| [:material-github: GitHub](https://github.com){target=_blank} |  GitHub will be used to store lecture materials and your own work. We will use [GitHub Education](https://education.github.com/){target=_blank} and its free features for hands-on.
| [CyVerse](https://user.cyverse.org/signup){target=_blank} | When creating your account, use the same email address you provided to NCEMS

## Sign up for Workshop

After creating your CyVerse Account (see above), enroll yourself in the workshop: [https://user.cyverse.org/workshops/194](https://user.cyverse.org/workshops/194){target=_blank}.

This will enable CyVerse's data science workbench, the [Discovery Environment](https://de.cyverse.org){target=_blank}, and its interactive Applications in [VICE](https://learning.cyverse.org/de/){target=_blank}


## Required Software

You will need to have the following software installed on your personal computer:

| Software | Notes |
| -------- | ----- |
| Web Browser | [:material-google-chrome: Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/dr/download/){target=_blank} or [:material-firefox: Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/){target=_blank} |
| Text Editor | [:material-microsoft-visual-studio-code: VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download){target=_blank} |

!!! Warning "**Attention** :material-microsoft-windows: Windows users"

    Much of what we are going to be teaching is based on open-source software which operates on cloud and is incompatible within Windows OS. *Don't worry*

    Unix-based systems such as Linux [:material-ubuntu: Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/){target=_blank} and [:material-apple: MacOS X](https://www.apple.com/macos/){target=_blank}, as many scientific tools require a Unix Operating System (OS). 
    
    There are a number of software that allow Windows users to execute Unix commands, however we recommend the use of [:material-microsoft-windows: Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) 2.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install){target=_blank}.

    [:material-microsoft-visual-studio-code: VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download){target=_blank} is a Microsoft product and integrates seamlessly with Unix systems, we therefore strongly encourage you to install Code on your Windows OS.
